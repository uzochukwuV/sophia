# 0G (Zero Gravity) Creator Platform — Design Patterns & Technical Guide

This document explains how to implement a multi‑segment creator platform (musicians, visual artists/painters, and influencers) on the 0G blockchain stack today, given that on‑chain AI primitives are currently text‑centric. The core strategy: keep heavy multimedia AI off‑chain via 0G’s Compute marketplace, store artifacts and proofs in 0G Storage, and anchor provenance/rights on the 0G Chain with optional Data Availability (DA) for high‑throughput feeds. Intelligent NFTs (ERC‑7857) are used to package and license creator “styles” or agents.

Executive summary

- What works today:
  - Run AI jobs (image upscaling, style transfer, audio stem separation, captioning) through 0G Compute providers via a broker.
  - Upload originals and outputs to 0G Storage to get Merkle roots and inclusion proofs.
  - Record on‑chain anchors in a lightweight PostRegistry (or your existing platform contract) and/or emit events.
  - For licensing styles/agents, mint ERC‑7857 INFTs with encrypted metadata and re‑encryption on transfer.
  - Use 0G DA to back high‑throughput social feeds and activity logs without clogging the L1.

- What is text‑centric on‑chain:
  - On‑chain LLM features are best used for orchestration, prompt policies, captions/credits storage, and rights metadata—not heavy multimodal inference.

Architecture overview

Components
- Frontend (Web): Next.js/React, wallet (wagmi/ethers), file uploader, job status UI.
- Backend (Service layer): Node/Express or Go; handles compute brokering, signing, optional key re‑encryption for INFTs, webhooks.
- 0G Storage: Decentralized storage; returns Merkle roots for provenance; used for originals, AI outputs, receipts, and encrypted packages.
- 0G Compute (Broker): Marketplace to submit inference jobs to providers; supports provider discovery and payments via a prepaid ledger.
- 0G Chain (EVM): Smart contracts (PostRegistry, tipping/subscriptions, marketplace, ERC‑7857).
- 0G Data Availability (DA): High‑throughput feeds (posts, comments, likes) and batch commitments.

High‑level flow
1) Upload original to 0G Storage → get inputRoot.
2) Submit job via 0G Compute broker → provider executes → returns result + signed receipt.
3) Upload output(s) to 0G Storage → get outputRoot(s).
4) Anchor provenance on‑chain: store {inputRoot, outputRoot(s), modelId, receiptHash, timestamps, creator}.
5) Optionally mint NFT/INFT, list for sale, accept tips/subscriptions.
6) Feed data written to DA for scale; periodic batch roots can be anchored to chain.

Core design patterns

A) Orchestrate inference off‑chain, verify on‑chain
- Problem: Multimedia models (audio/image/video) are too heavy for on‑chain execution.
- Solution: Execute via 0G Compute providers; store artifacts in 0G Storage; anchor concise proofs on‑chain.
- Anchor: {inputRoot, outputRoot(s), jobId, providerPubKey, signature, model/version, timestamp, cost}.

B) Verifiable receipts & attestation
- Require providers to sign receipts covering inputs/outputs and model/version.
- Store hash(receipt) on‑chain; store full receipt JSON in 0G Storage for later verification.
- Prefer providers offering TEE attestation when available.

C) On‑chain orchestration, off‑chain heavy lifting
- Keep policy, licensing, payment splits, and canonical text metadata on‑chain.
- Keep generation and large artifacts off‑chain.

D) INFTs (ERC‑7857) for licensing styles/agents
- INFT metadata includes model/style descriptors, license terms, royalty info, and an encrypted access blob/URI.
- On transfer, re‑encrypt keys for the new owner (backend or decentralized re‑encryption service).
- Providers can verify ownership before honoring “licensed inference”.

E) Data Availability for feeds
- Post activity (compact feed messages) to DA.
- Periodically anchor DA batch roots on‑chain for finality and audits.
- Index DA for fast UI reads.

F) Provider discovery & multi‑provider failover
- Use broker discovery to pick providers; implement retry/fallback to alternate models/providers.
- Expose ETA and price estimates in UI.

G) Moderation as an auditable step
- Run moderation models via compute before publish.
- Record moderation receipts (policyHash, resultHash, timestamp, moderatorSig) on‑chain or in DA.

End‑to‑end technical flows

Flow 1 — Music: upload → stem separation → minting
1) Upload song.wav → 0G Storage → inputRoot.
2) Compute broker: createJob({ task: "stem_sep", inputRoot, model: "open-music-stem-v1" }).
3) Provider returns stems + signed providerReceipt (jobId, roots, model/version, ts, cost).
4) Upload stems → {vocalsRoot, drumsRoot, ...}.
5) Anchor on‑chain: {inputRoot, [outputRoots], modelId, receiptHash, creator}.
6) Optionally mint track NFT; royalties and splits encoded in contract.

Flow 2 — Visual style transfer with limited editions
1) Upload original.png → inputRoot.
2) Select stylePackage → styleRoot (0G Storage).
3) Compute broker: createJob({ task: "style_transfer", inputRoot, styleRoot, model: "style-v2" }).
4) Upload output → outputRoot; anchor with receiptHash.
5) Mint limited edition NFTs referencing outputRoot; manage royalty splits and auctions in contract.

Flow 3 — Influencer short clip authenticity + sponsor payout
1) Upload clip.mp4 → inputRoot.
2) Compute broker: captioning + thumbnail + authenticity stamp.
3) Upload outputs → outputRoot(s); anchor receiptHash and captionHash.
4) Sponsor pays a payout contract that releases funds when the post anchor is observed.
5) Feed entry to DA; metrics are aggregated off‑chain and optionally committed as hashed reports.

Flow 4 — INFT licensing & key re‑wrapping
1) Package style/agent → encrypted blob to 0G Storage → styleRoot.
2) Mint INFT (ERC‑7857) with encryptedAccessBlob and license terms hash.
3) On sale, re‑wrap keys for buyer; update transfer proof (oracle/attestation as needed).
4) Compute providers check INFT ownership and accept buyer’s time‑limited access tokens.

SDKs, contracts, and stack

Frontend
- Next.js/React + wagmi/ethers for wallet flows.
- File upload UI, job monitor, provenance badges, and feed components.

0G Storage (TypeScript)
- Upload/download, Merkle roots, inclusion proofs.
- Store originals, outputs, receipts, encrypted packages.

0G Compute Broker (TypeScript)
- Initialize broker with signer.
- Fund a small prepaid ledger.
- Discover providers and submit jobs.
- Retrieve results and signed receipts.

Illustrative snippets (replace placeholders with actual SDK calls per latest docs):

```ts
// Storage: upload a file and get a root hash
import { StorageClient } from '@0glabs/0g-ts-sdk';

const storage = new StorageClient({ rpcUrl: process.env.OG_STORAGE_RPC! });
const { root, proof, uri } = await storage.upload(file); // uri points to retrievable content

// Compute: run an inference job
import { createZGComputeNetworkBroker } from '@0glabs/0g-serving-broker';

const broker = createZGComputeNetworkBroker(signer);
await broker.ledger.addLedger('0.1'); // prepay some credits

const job = await broker.createJob({
  task: 'style_transfer',
  model: 'style-v2',
  inputRoot: root,
  params: { strength: 0.8 }
});

const result = await job.getResult();       // result.artifact, result.receipt
const receiptHash = result.receipt.hash;    // hash of signed receipt
const outputUpload = await storage.upload(result.artifact);
```

Smart contracts
- PostRegistry: minimal registry to anchor provenance entries.
- Tipping/subscriptions: escrow and split logic.
- Marketplace: fixed price and auction listings.
- ERC‑7857: INFT mint, encrypted metadata updates, oracle/attestation hooks.

Note: If you already use a rich platform contract (e.g., NeuralCreatorPlatform), you can:
- Call publishContent with content hashes (Storage roots),
- Use tipContent/subscribe/purchase functions for monetization,
- Integrate INFT/Traditional NFT contracts and call markAsNFT for linkage.

0G Data Availability
- Write feed messages (compact JSON or binary) to DA for low‑latency reads.
- Periodically commit DA batch roots to chain for auditability.

Indexing
- Off‑chain indexer to read Storage/DA and contract events, populate a query API for the UI.

Security, trust, and moderation

- Key management: never expose server keys in the browser. Use wallet signatures for user actions; keep backend keys in a vault.
- Receipts: require provider signatures; verify before anchoring. Store full receipts in Storage; store receiptHash on‑chain.
- Attestation: prefer TEEs or verifiable execution when available; include attestation hashes in receipts.
- Moderation: pre‑publish moderation jobs via broker; anchor moderation decision with policy hashes.
- Payments: use nonReentrant guards and explicit checks in Solidity; keep platform/taker fees bounded and configurable by admin roles.

---

UX, costs, and performance

- Async job UX: show ETA, cost estimates, progress, and “ready” notifications.
- DA‑backed feeds: near‑real‑time reads; periodic anchoring provides verifiable history.
- Storage tiers: hot vs cold; surface retrieval times/fees if applicable.
- Pricing: prepay credits or pay‑per‑use; display remaining balance and job cost receipts.

Prototype plan (hackathon‑ready)

Day 0 — Setup
- Configure testnet RPCs (Chain/Storage/DA), install @0glabs/0g‑ts‑sdk and @0glabs/0g‑serving‑broker.
- Prepare env vars and a faucet/treasury test wallet.

Day 1 — Storage + Provenance
- Build upload UI; show Merkle root and “View on 0G” link.
- Save minimal PostRegistry anchor with {inputRoot, creator, ts}.

Day 2 — Compute integration
- Wire one multimodal task (image upscaling or audio stems).
- Capture provider receipt; upload output; anchor receiptHash + outputRoot.

Day 3 — Feed + Tips
- Render a DA‑backed feed; add tipping via contract; show provenance badges.

Day 4 — INFT demo (stretch)
- Mint an ERC‑7857 INFT for a “style pack” (encrypted blob).
- Demonstrate transfer and key re‑wrapping in a simple flow.

Day 5 — Polish
- Add moderation, cost meter, and a short demo video.

---

Limitations and legal/IP notes

- Provider coverage: not all models may be available at all times; implement graceful fallback.
- Latency/cost: audio/video jobs are heavier; set clear expectations and allow background processing.
- IP and licensing: encode license terms in INFTs and marketplace contracts; keep a visible audit trail of rights and provenance.
- Content policy: maintain moderation policies and publish policy hashes to improve transparency.

Appendix: minimal schemas

ProvenanceAnchor (on‑chain or emitted event)
```
struct ProvenanceAnchor {
  bytes32 inputRoot;
  bytes32[] outputRoots;
  bytes32 receiptHash;
  bytes32 modelId;
  uint64  timestamp;
  address creator;
}
```

ProviderReceipt (stored in 0G Storage)
```
{
  "jobId": "…",
  "inputRoot": "0x…",
  "outputs": ["0x…", "0x…"],
  "modelId": "style-v2",
  "modelVersion": "2.1.0",
  "timestamp": 1712345678,
  "cost": "0.0042",
  "providerPubKey": "0x…",
  "signature": "0x…" // over a canonical receipt digest
}
```

INFT encrypted metadata
```
{
  "styleRoot": "0x…",
  "licenseTermsHash": "0x…",
  "ownerPublicKey": "0x…",
  "encryptedAccessBlobURI": "og://storage/…",
  "capabilities": ["image_generation", "style_transfer"]
}
```

Notes
- Replace SDK package names and RPC endpoints with those from the latest 0G docs.
- Keep receipts and encrypted blobs small on‑chain; put heavy JSON and media in 0G Storage.
